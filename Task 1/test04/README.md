# Test 04

## Standard track

Write down a letter with your vision how to build a fail-safe server/system containing:

* Small Web-server with 2k users per day
* 1TB relational database
* 2 billion requests per day
* All data is highly sensitive
* Acceptable data loss — 0.5hr
* Acceptable downtime — 1hr

Notes:

* Drawings are welcome.  
* Handwritten drawings — too.

There is no fail if you have no experience in such planning — think how would you build such service. We'd like to know the way you're thinking and how do you tell your thoughts.

## Bonus track

Write down your vision for the backup/restore routine for the setup above.

## Bonus track #2

Write down the automation routine for the setup above.
