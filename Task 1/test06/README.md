# Test 06

## Standard track

Using the language is best for you from the Python/Ruby/Java/Go list:

* Write a script that scans folder size and disk free space and deletes files older than 6 months if size exceeded desired limit.

## Bonus track

* Write a script that listens to desired ports, writes down the originating IP to the log and drops the connection.

## Bonus track #2

* Add a gitlab-ci\jenkinsfile\another CI/CD system file that performs tests against your script and deploys it to a server.
