# Task 5

## Case

We use AWS for hosting our solution. For operating our infrastructure we need a HA Consul cluster distributed over at least 3 availability zones. The setup and maintenance should be fully automated. Consul instances should discover themselves using DNS

## Task

* Automate the deployment and management of a Consul cluster
* Choose a concept/tool to automate the deployment and provisioning of the needed AWS resources and servers
* Implement and test your solution
* Provide us with a git repository showing not only the result, but also the way youâ€™ve taken to implement your solution
